# Pong Game
In 1972, the game of Pong was released by Atari. Despite its simplicity, it was a ground-breaking game in its day, and it has been credited as having helped launch the video game industry.   
 
This project is completed by Zikun Chen, Hang Yin and Junkai Cheng.
## Part1
We will create a simple version of Pong and use Q-learning and SARSA to train agents to play the game.

## Part2
We will use deep learning to learn a mapping between the game state and action taken by the agent. If we sucessfully learn the mapping function, then our agent should be able to replicate the performance of the expert.
